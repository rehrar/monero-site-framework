Monero is a cryptocurrency designed from the ground up to deliver always-on privacy and anonymity.

No one can see how much you hold or how you spend, even if they know your wallet address. The amounts of transactions are confidential, and the source of funds in every transaction is untraceable. Always-on privacy means that every Monero user's activity enhances the privacy of all other users.

Monero's Kovri project (coming soon) encrypts and routes transactions through the I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes to protect you from network monitoring. 

Over 240 developers have contributed to the Monero project. Forums and chat channels are welcoming and active. Monero's Research Lab and Core Development Team is constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy and security.

To get started with Monero, download the Monero wallet. You can buy Monero on many exchanges using your local currency or other cryptocurrencies and send them to your wallet locally to use and send to anyone, anywhere in the world.

Wallet files are encrypted on disk and locked with a passphrase, rendering them useless if stolen.

### Untraceable

Monero uses a ring signatures that allows you to send and receive funds privately. Even though your transactions are publicly verifiable on the blockchain, transactions use digital signatures that specify a group of signers such that the verifier canâ€™t tell which member actually produced the signature.

Because there is no way to know if a particular output was used "nefariously" or not, there will never be such a thing as blacklisted Monero.
