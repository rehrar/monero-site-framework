# Monero "press-ready" 3-line statement

Monero is a community-driven cryptocurrency designed to deliver always-on fungibility, privacy, and anonymity. Monero's Kovri I2P Router Project provides users with the ability to run and access nodes that hide their geographic location and IP address. When used in conjunction with Kovri, the origin of Monero transactions is concealed to protect the privacy of the sender while mitigating network monitoring and other attacks.

# WIP draft to replace/amend the Monero sub-headings below

Monero is a cryptocurrency designed from scratch to deliver always-on privacy and anonymity.

No one can see how rich you are or how you spend, even if they know your wallet address. The amounts of transactions are confidential, and the source of funds in every transaction is untraceable. Always-on privacy means that every Monero user's activity enhances the privacy of all other users.

Monero's Kovri project (coming soon) encrypts and routes transactions through the I2P Invisible Internet Project nodes to protect you from network monitoring. 

Over 240 developers have contributed to the Monero project. Forums and chat channels are welcoming and active. Monero's Research Lab and Core Development Team is constantly pushing the frontier of what is possible with cryptocurrency privacy and security.

To get started with Monero, download the Monero wallet. Then buy some Monero using dollars, pounds or euros from an exchange. The funds will appear in your Monero wallet, and you will be able to send funds to anyone, anywhere in the world.

## Monero
### Private Digital Currency

Monero is a secure, private, untraceable currency. It is open-source and freely available to all. With Monero, you are your own bank. Only you control and are responsible for your funds, and your accounts and transactions are private by default, keeping them from prying eyes.

## What is Monero?

### Monero is secure

Monero can't be hacked to steal your funds, due to the power of distributed consensus, which you can read about [here](). This means that you are responsible for your money, and don't have to trust any entity to keep it safe for you.

### Monero is private

The power of the blockchain usually increases security at the cost of privacy, but with [Monero's sophisticated privacy-centric technology](/get-started/how-it-works.html), you get all of the security benefits of the blockchain without any of the privacy trade-offs.

### Monero is untraceable

By taking advantage of ring signatures, Monero makes it ambiguous which funds have been spent, and thus extremely unlikely that a transaction could be linked to particular user.

### Fungible

Because of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies, Monero is fungible, meaning one Monero will always be equal to another. This means you won't hae to worry about Monero blacklisted by exchanges or vendors.

Monero is the only truly fungible digital currency, meaning, one Monero will always be equal to another, because of the on-by-default nature of the privacy technologies. There will never be such a thing as blacklisted Monero.
