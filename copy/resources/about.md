# A Brief History

Monero was launched in April 2014 as a fair, pre-announced version of the CryptoNote reference code. This means that there was no premine or instantmine, and no portion of the block reward goes to development. See the original Bitcointalk thread [here]( https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=583449.0). The founder, thankful_for_today, proposed some controversial changes that the community disagreed with, so fallout ensued. The current Monero Core Team forked the project and the community followed them.

Monero has made several large improvements since launch. The blockchain was migrated to a different database structure to provide greater efficiency and flexibility, minimum ring signature sizes were set so that all transactions were private by mandate, and RingCT was implemented to hide the transaction amounts. Nearly all improvements have provided improvements to security or privacy, or they have facilitated use. Monero continues to develop with goals of privacy and security first, ease of use and efficiency second.

# Our Values

Monero is more than just a technology; It’s also a guiding philosophy. Some of the important guiding philosophies are:

-	Security. Users must be able to trust Monero with their transactions, without risk of error or attack. Monero gives the full block reward to the miners, who are the most critical members of the network who provide this security. Transactions are cryptographically secured using the latest and most resilient encryption tools available.

-	Privacy. Monero takes privacy seriously. Monero understands the need to be able to protect users privacy in such as matters as law, where in extreme cases, a lack of privacy of transactions can possibly mean the death penalty. Privacy must be completely accessible to all users, whether they are technologically competent or have no idea how Monero works. A user needs to be able to trust Monero in a way that they do not have to worry about changing their spending habits for risk of others finding out.

-	Decentralization. Monero is committed to providing the maximum amount of decentralization. With Monero, you do not have to trust anyone else on the network, and it is not run by any large group. An accessible “Proof of Work” algorithm makes it easy to mine Monero on normal computers, which makes it more difficult for someone to purchase a large amount of mining power. Nodes connect to each other with I2P to lower the risks of revealing sensitive transaction information and censorship (tba). Development decisions are extremely clear and open to public discussion. Developer meeting logs are published online in their entirety and visible by all.
