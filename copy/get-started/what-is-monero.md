# What is Monero 

Monero provides a platform and interface for private, anonymous and secure financial activity; a crytpographically sound digital currency for peer to peer value exchange. With Monero, you are your own bank, and only you control your funds. There are no centralised agents, state actors, or censor mechanisms. Monero is an open source project, and was fairly launched on April 18th, 2014 without any form of token premine or instamine. The development of the currency is donation-based and community-driven. It is one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the post-Bitcoin world and is built on principles of privacy, decentralization, and scalability. 

Read on to find out how Monero is helping solve the real problems and limitations of existing digital currencies by building a a completely private and cryptographically secure blockchain.

# Main Features

## Privacy

Monero values your financial privacy. Privacy is a central tenant of the project, as it seeks to provide a platform for absolute transactional privacy. With Bitcoin, as well as the majority of cryptocurrencies that have been established since, any and all transactions are traceable. An observer can analyse the Bitcoin blockchain, and for any transaction, find out the transacted amount, precise transaction origin (sender address), and destination (recipient address). 

With Monero, for any private transaction, the same observer has no means to uncover the origin, destination, or amount transacted. Transactions on the Monero blockchain are private, anonymous, and untraceable. With Monero, transactions are private by default. However, each user has the ability to select different levels of privacy, optionally disclosing their transaction information, or even provide audit access (view only) to their full Monero account.

Monero's privacy has been afforded by implementations of software based technologies such as Stealth Addresses, Ring Signatures, and RingCT, which ensure that detailed analysis of Monero's blockchain is impossible. 

## Scaleability

Monero understands the importance of scaling, especially with regards the issue of block size and the fee market. Monero implements a dynamic block size, which means the limit on the size of each block is regularly recalculated automatically, based on a look-back window. In times of increased activity, the limit is relaxed, allowing the Monero blockchain to efficiently and succintly deal with periods of increased demand for transaction capacity, while a penalty system prevents any untethered block size growth. 

A second issue with most cryptocurrencies is the development and maintenance of a fee market. Transaction fees, coupled with block rewards, are the main incentive for miners to secure the blockchain. At the moment, miners act as they are expected: mining on the longest chain. If they act differently, they risk losing the block reward. Monero imlements a "permanent block reward", which will never drop below 0.3 XMR, making Monero a disinflationary currency. The rate of inflation will contiunally decrease. The inflation rate will be roughly 1% in 2022, continually reducing from that point on. However, the nominal inflation rate will stay at 0.3 XMR per minute. This ensures there will always be an incentive for miners to mine Monero; keeping the blockchain secure, with or without a fee market.

### Decentralization

Monero is powered strictly by Proof of Work (PoW), but specifically it employs a mining algorithm that has the potential to be efficiently tasked to billions of existing devices (any modern x86 CPU). This characteristic has the potential to ensure that the process of mining Monero coins is within reach of the common individual, not an exclusive opportunity to the owners of large mining operations. This is the core of Monero's commitment to decentralization, and is reflected in the fact that the current Monero GUI Beta 2 allows individuals to mine directly from their home computer, without any other hardware or software. 

 This commitment to development decentralization is another core tenant of the Monero model. Monero's development landscape is the opposite of a closed or restricted access model. The core branch currently enjoys more than 30 contributors, pushing 1000+ commits over the past year. The project is happy to take on new contributors, and indeed welcomes it, while future plans, long-term directions, and priorities are openly discussed with the community as a whole. The policy that governs contribution to the Monero codebase is exhaustingly inclusive - all contributions are accepted into the development branch, where new code can be scrutinized and tested by the entire community. 

Contributors in the Monero development landscape are passionate for an open source philosophy, and in this rich creative environment new projects have emerged, and thrived. OpenAlias is one notable example, which has seen adoption by (amongst others) a major Bitcoin-related software product.

### Fungibility

Fungibility is a crucial property of any functioning currency. When a currency is referred to as fungibile, it means that all units are viewed "equal". Without fungibility, money flows can be tracked, tainted and monitored - deterring how currency may be used for secure and private value transfer. Using non-fungible tokens as currency may lead to eventual blacklisting/whitelisting, either by government, or through self-censorship. Some examples of these measures could be payment processors or exchanges refusing your tainted coins as payment or deposit, or miners refusing to include your suspicious transactions into the blockchain. 

Monero transaction outputs have "plausible deniability" about their state: you cannot prove if they are spent or unspent in a certain transaction or not. This leads to an opaque (non-transparent) blockchain; ensuring that all coins are "equal". Fungibility is a property built into Monero at the protocol level.
