Financial privacy is important but in recent years corporations, banks, and governments have have seen databases compromised, leaking private and sensitive information to potentially nefarious agents; information about users, uses, practices and finances. The unfortunate, but undeniable, conclusion is that there is great need for safe and secure methods of conducting financial transactions. Monero is a cytopgraphically secure, decentralized, private digital currency that enables such value transfer.  

Monero is a crytpographically sound digital currency that enables private and secure peer to peer value exchange. Crucially, it is fungibile, meaning that all units are viewed "equal". This is of paramount importance for any currency. Without fungibility, money flows can be tracked, tainted and monitored, deterring how the currency may be used for secure and private value transfer. Transactions using Monero are untraceable, as the currency is built on state of the art implementations of cryptographic technologies such as Ring Signatures and RingCT. The implementation of this technology means that it almost impossible to trace a particular transaction to an individual user. 

The Monero project is open source and was fairly launched on April 18th, 2014 without any form of token premine or instamine. The development of the currency is donation-based, and community-driven, as Monero exists to leverage the privacy and anonymity the user; affording them a value transfer token built specifically for this purpose. 

With Monero, you are your own bank, and only you control your funds. There are no centralised agents, state actors, or censor mechanisms. Your accounts, funds and transactions are truly private, secure, and encrypted; more so than a host of other digital currencies.

Read on to find out how Monero is helping solve the real problems and limitations of existing digital currencies by building a a completely private and cryptographically secure blockchain.
