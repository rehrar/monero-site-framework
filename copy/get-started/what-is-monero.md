# A Decentralized, Anonymous and Secure Digital Currency.

Monero is an completely anonymous and decentralized digital currency. Monero strives to achieve completely fungibility as a digital currency, where each individual unit of the currency is capable of mutual substitution. By default, all transactions are untraceable in the blockchain through the obfuscation of sender and recipient wallet addresses and transaction amounts. 

# Features

## Decentralization

Monero functions on a decentralized network using blockchain technology. No central server or core team is required for the operation of the protocol. 

## Security

Every transaction is secured using proof-of-work mining. Individual wallets employ a 25 word mnenomic seed for backup and restoration.

## Anonymity

Sending and receiving addresses are obfuscated on the blockchain through the use of stealth addresses. Transaction amounts are obfuscated through ring confidential transaction technology.
