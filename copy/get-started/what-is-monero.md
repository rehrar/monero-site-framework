# About Monero
 
### This is just test commit and first section - /u/midipoet
 
Financial privacy is important, but in recent years corporations, banks and governments have have seen databases compromised, leaking private and sensitive information to potentially nefarious agents; information about users, uses, practices and finances. The unfortunate, but undeniable, conclusion is that there is great need for safe and secure methods of conducting value transactions. Monero is a cytopgraphically secure, decentralized, private digital currency that enables such transfer of value.  

Monero provides the platform and interface for private and secure financial activity. It is one of the leading cryptocurrencies in the post-Bitcoin world, and it is built on principles of privacy, decentralization, and scalability. 

First and foremost Monero is a crytpographically sound digital currency that enables private and secure peer to peer value exchange. Crucially, it is fungibile, meaning that all units are viewed as "equal", which is of paramount value for any currency. Without fungibility, money flows can be tracked, tainted, and monitored, deterring how digital tokens can be used as secure and private value transfer. Not only is Monero cryptographically secure, but also untraceable, built on state of the art implementation of cryptographic technologies such as Ring Signatures and RingCT. 

Monero is an open source project, freely available to all and was fairly launched on April 18th, 2014 without any form of token premine or instamine. The development of the currency is donation-based, and community-driven, as Monero exists to leverage the privacy and security of the user; affording them a value transfer token built speficially this purpose. 

With Monero, you are your own bank, and only you control your funds. There are no centralised agents, state actors, or censor mechanisms. Your accounts, funds and transactions are private, secure, and encrypted; far more than can be said for a host of current day digital currencies.

Read on to find out how Monero is helping solve the real problems and limitations of existing digital currencies by building a a completely private and cryptographically secure blockchain.
