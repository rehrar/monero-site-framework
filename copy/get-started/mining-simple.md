# What is mining?

Mining is critically important for the protection of the Monero network. Mining is the process of solving math problems provided by the Monero network. These problems get more difficult if more people are trying to solve them, and they get less difficult when less people are. The problems are difficult enough to be solved about once every two minutes.

Why bother giving miners problems to solve? The person who solves the problem can determine the latest Monero transactions to be included in the blockchain. If one person can make these decisions all the time, it could lead to censorship and attacks. Mining allows anyone the chance to solve this problem, making the solver of the next problem unpredictable. If no single entity controls a large portion of the network, the network can stay secure.

Monero uses a more accessible Proof of Work algorithm called CryptoNight, which relies on a lot of memory. ASICS, or special hardware specifically for mining, have a very low amount of memory, making it extremely difficult to mine Monero with an ASIC. Monero is committed to an accessible Proof of Work and will switch to a different, more resistance algorithm if necessary.

Below, you can see the steps to mine from the [official Monero GUI](https://getmonero.org/downloads). This is the easiest way to start mining Monero!

Once you have synchronized with the blockchain (read more about this here), click on the "Advanced" tab and then the "Mining" tab that appears under it. Follow 3 basic steps:

1. Put in the number of threads you would like to use. It should equal the size of your CPU's memory cache divided by 2. Look up the specs on your manufacturer's website to find the right amount.

2. Tick the "smart mining" box. This will automatically mine in the background while you are not using your computer. When this box is ticked, you will be able to use your computer like normal without worrying about your laptop's battery or additional lag.

3. Click "Start Mining". You're done! Congratulations!

There are several more advanced ways to mine, especially for professionals. If you have an expensive computer or a dedicated mining machine, you can click here for more advanced options.
